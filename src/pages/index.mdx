# Hi, I'm Aengus

Homeschooled and military raised, after graduating with a computer science degree from University of Washington I spent four years working on emerging markets and reliability for the Facebook Android app.

I quit that job last year to redesign my life. Since then I have spent my time traveling, working to improve myself and my habits, and diving into a variety of side projects to decide how I want to spend my time.

Currently my focus is on Android Apps and Game Development. I'm a contributing developer on [Hirt](https://playhirt.com), I have spent some time building the Gouda Engine as [Cheddar Games](https://cheddargames.com), and now I'm working on an Android app for audio note capture that I hope to write more about soon.

Here on my site you can find my writings on education, audio, and programming.
