Check out the [[Books]] I am reading

Or maybe my [[Writing Ideas]]

This is very much a work in progress. I will try and format more content for here as I get used to this system and think of things I want to share publicly.

I'm also working on improving the styling of course, will figure out previews of linked references as soon as possible, and if possible I would like to do more interactions in terms of opening multiple notes at the same time as well.

This is all built as a [[Gatsby]] plugin, I will be working on open sourcing it hopefully soon. Need to clean up the code first a bit. In the meantime, you can find the very hacky version on my website's [Github](https://github.com/aengusmcmillin/aengusmcmillin.com/tree/master/plugins/gatsby-transform-brain).
