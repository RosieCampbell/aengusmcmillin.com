- GTD is: "A toolset toolset to help people focus their energy strategically and tactically without letting anything fall through the cracks"
- It is about automating as much of productivity as possible so we can focus on the best parts
- Status quo = crisis response mode, there are psychological benefits that trick us into thinking it is better

- **Open Loops on Your Mind**
- The first step is to have a comprehensive task list to capture everything
- Stress is caused by mishandling commitments
- Uncaptured commitments are called Open Loops
- Challenge: Every Open Loop needs to be written down, no matter how trivial
- **How to Capture Open Loops**
- Start with the inboxes. This can include apps, recorders, task managers, email, etc...
- 3 Rules:
  - Every loop must be captured in an inbox
  - You must have as few containers as possible
  - You must empty them regularly
- For step 2, start by installing a task manager
- Then setup one digital container and one physical one
- **Unit 3: Processing tasks**
- 3 rules for processing
  - Process top item first
  - Process one at a time
  - Never put anything back in the inbox
- First question
- Second question, is it actionable?
- If it isn't actionable, send it to trash, someday/maybe, or your reference system
- Next step is to setup a reference container (in this case Evernote)
- After this should have a concrete and comprehensive list of tasks that are highly actionable
- **Let's Get Physical and Specific**
- What's the next physical action for each item?
- Physical action because it is hard to decide exactly what needs to be done, whereas focusing on physical actions makes it very concrete
- Most items in the task manager are actually projects that need to be broken down by several levels and next physical action identified
- Lots of words used for todo items that are unclear: "set meeting", "decide on", "check out", "organize", etc...
