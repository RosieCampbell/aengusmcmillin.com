Tags: #[[What I Know]]

## Tags
- Tags are the most basic element of HTML. They are the building blocks that contain the stuff that goes on the site.
- They may be either opened and then closed with a closing tag, or they may be self closing.
- Order of closing is important, treat the same as parenthesis.
- Examples:
  - Closing tags: `<div><p>Some Content</p></div>` 
  - Self Closing: `<br />`
- "Important Tags:"
  - "`<h1><h2><h3><h4><h5><h6>` Heading tags. Use for titles, subtitles, and other things that provide structure to the page. No hard and fast rules for when to use what."
  - "`<p>Some Text</p>` Paragraph tags. Only text, do your writing in here."
  - "`<a href="https://google.com">Google</a>` Anchor tags. Used for links. Put the link inside the href. href is an attribute (attributes covered later)"
  - "`<div>` Division tag. This is a box that other things go into. No meaning in itself, just a container."
  - "`<span>` Container for small pieces of text. Used for targeting specific bits of  your content for custom styling and behavior."
  - "`<ol>` and `<ul>` Ordered lists (numbered) and Unordered lists (bulleted). `<li>` is a list item element. List items must live inside of one of the list types. "
